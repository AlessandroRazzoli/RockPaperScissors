# RockPaperScissors
Mini game of rock paper scissors in javascript 

## Description 
Classic rock paper scissors where you can choose one button out of a trio, each one representing one of the three elements to play, versus a "Bot" that just pick one of the playable option by generating a random number between 0 and 2. Once you click a button, the corresponding image of the element you picked will be displayed at the bottom of the canvas, same goes with your foe, whose choice's corresponding image will be displayed at the top. 
Under the three buttons there is a line that works as a console: it will say whether you won, lost or tied. You score and you enemy's will be displayed at the bottom of the page and it will be updated every time you click one of the three buttons.
